  <b>Player Profiling via Hierarchical Clustering</b><br>
  Cluster NBA players by their physical attributes — visualize hidden player types using unsupervised learning.
</p>

## 📌 Project Overview

**CourtClusters** uses *Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering* to analyze and group NBA players based on:

- 🏗️ Height  
- ⚖️ Weight  
- ⏳ Age (derived from year of birth)

This unsupervised learning approach reveals natural clusters among players — helpful for scouting, analytics, and building strategy.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm: Hierarchical Clustering

We use **Agglomerative Clustering** with **Ward's linkage**:

> Starts by treating each player as its own cluster, then repeatedly merges the closest pairs until 3 final clusters remain.

### 🔬 Features Used:
- `height`
- `weight`
- `age = 2025 - born`

### 📊 Visual Tools:
- 📈 **Dendrogram** to explore cluster merges
- 🔵 **PCA 2D Scatter Plot** to show final clusters
